		<p>Title: Ras'koth Origins
		<br>
		Semester/Year:Fall 2020
		<br>
		Software: Aduicty, After Affects
		<br>
		My final multimedia project was inspired by fantasy games and movies, and I made up names, my character is an elf that hails from a world full of magic, monsters from Dragons, to Gods, to the Undead, and everything in between. He is an adventurer just like you would be in a game, he has a race (elf) and class (Assassin), I made up all the names and his own backstory and personality that I think will fit in well with his class, I made up a whole new origin story of my character and what he has been through, I will use pictures of various aspects that connect to the world of my character and what has transpired that got him to this point in the story. I will use After affects to move form picture to picture while starting at one side of the picture and moving its slowly to the center to reveal more of it, kind of like slideshow, I will have a narrator voice (the character), using Audacity combined with ambient sounds, explaining the story and everything, I used to same pictures and more as I did in the storyboard.
